# Shoutcast-Directory-Crawler

I wrote this app to quickly crawl [shoutcast directory website](https://directory.shoutcast.com/) and extra online radio metadatas.


The reason I wrote this script is because I requested an access to get `apiKey` or something but I have not received any response in months.

- To download m3u file use the following pattern (replace ID with shoutcast unique ID for each radio):

http://yp.shoutcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.m3u?id=99241165

- Note that attached `shoutcast-directory.json` is not complete. Run the script for yourself to generate the complete file.
